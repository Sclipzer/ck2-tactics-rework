# Tweaked Tactics

A Crusader Kings II Mod

A full re-do of all the combat tactics ingame, replacing all the vanilla tactics with 83 new ones. One of the big goals with this mod is to discourage spamming only one type of unit, to always trigger the same tactics. A diverse army will perform better than a pure stack of only one unit with this mod. There is also an attempt at encouraging use of light units, and they will be necessary to increase the chance of some strong tactics for heavy units triggering.
